simple NN generate - has the NN class and the optimized 
iris train - the code to genetically train the iris classifier
iris dataset - primary dataset used to train in part 1
gauss-newton - shows gauss-newton without clutter
test IRIS model - useful to see how well I did on parts 1 and 2
direct comparison of weights - useful to see how well I did on part 2
optimized wire meg array - not optimized but makes nice pictures
parallel num solver with few sens - the way I trained the new model in part 2
iris.pickle - the iris classifier trained in part 1
4IRISrecon.pickle - the iris classifier trained to recreate iris.pickle in part 2
